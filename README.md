# Lapland Memory Orb - Unity Plugin and Demo
**v0.5** _(network, 3D models added)_

Unity plugin and demo for the memory orb made at the [University of Lapland](https://www.ulapland.fi/EN) and [Lapland University of Applied Sciences](https://www.lapinamk.fi/en) as part of the [Lapland Robotics](https://laplandrobotics.com) and [Digital Access to SÃ¡mi Heritage Archives](https://digisamiarchives.com) projects.

The plugin includes a network (over WiFi) and protocol (read code sent from the microcontroller) management, an interactive prefabs of the memory orb and a sample demo.
